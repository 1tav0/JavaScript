/***Main Idea of Javascript***/
1. save the data 
2. generate the html 
3. make it interactive
  -   HOW DO WE KNOW WHICH PRODUCT TO ADD TO CART ?
    - DATA ATTRIBUTE: 
     - is just another HTML attribute 
     - allows us to attach any information to an element 
    - SYNTAX FOR A DATA ATTRIBUTE 
     - is just an HTML attribute 
     - have to start with "data-"
     - then give it any name 
          name                      value 
      ...data-procduct-name = "${product.name}">
    -WHAT IS THE PURPOSE FOR A DATA ATTRIBUTE?
      - can attach the data image, price, etc.
      - note: if we console.log(button.dataset) in the console we will go from data-product-name KEBAB-CASE to PRODUCTNAME 
  - NOW THAT WE ADDED SUCCESFULLY TO THE CART HOW CAN WE INCREASE THE QUANTITY INSTEAD OF REPEATING DATA IN THE ARRAY ?
    - STEPS: 
     - Check if the product is already in the cart, if so increase the quanity 
     - if not then add it to the cart
  - INSTEAD OF USING THE PRODUCT NAME TO IDENTIFY EACH ITEM WE MUST USE AN ID THIS WAY IF TWO ITEMS HAVE THE SAME NAME BUT DIFFERENT BRANDS IT WILL STILL WORK
